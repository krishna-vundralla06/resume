            <p>
            Our project is that we developed an Android Application on “RENTAL RESOURCES SRIKAKULAM”.<br>
			This application is about to provide rentals for all the resources like cars and other vehicles<br>
			. The unique option in this application is “RC Workers”<br>
			. The RC Workers are categorized into many types like plumbers, car mechanics and bike mechanics etc<br>
			. This application is available in play store but it doesn’t contain any resources<br>. It is under maintenance.
